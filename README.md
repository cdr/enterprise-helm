## Contributing

All of the Helm charts for Coder services are contained in the
[`templates`][template-folder] folder.

Template values and documentation are in the [`values.yaml`][values-file] file.
The values table in the README is parsed from that file.

This README file is generated from [`README.md.gotmpl`][readme-template-file].
When adding content to the README make sure to update that file.

When adding a value or updating the README template make sure to document it
and run [`gen-readme.sh`][gen-readme-file]. This will update and format the
values table and additional docs.
