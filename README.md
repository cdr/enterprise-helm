Coder moves developer workspaces to your cloud and centralizes their creation and management. Keep developers in flow with the power of the cloud and a superior developer experience.

The Coder chart is the best way to operate Coder on Kubernetes. It contains all the required components, and can scale to large deployments.

| coderd.turn.enable | bool | enables the TURN server and allows networking V2 alpha to be enabled in site config. | `false` |
| deploymentAnnotations | object |  | `{}` |
| devurls.host | string | Should be a wildcard hostname to allow matching against custom-created dev URLs. Leaving as an empty string results in devurls being disabled. Example: "*.devurls.coder.com". | `""` |
| envbox.image | string | Injected during releases. | `""` |
| environments.nodeSelector | object | nodeSelector is applied to all user environments to specify eligible nodes for environments to run on. See: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector  eg. nodeSelector:   disktype: ssd | `{}` |

| ingress.additionalAnnotations | list | Deprecated. Please use `ingress.annotations`. | `[]` |

| ingress.deployment.kind | string | How to deploy the built-in ingress. Can be "Deployment" or "DaemonSet". | `"Deployment"` |

| ingress.useDefault | bool | If set to true, will deploy an nginx ingress that will allow you to access Coder from an external IP address, but only if your kubernetes cluster is configured to provision external IP addresses. If you would like to bring your own ingress and hook Coder into that instead, set this value to false. | `true` |
| ingress.usePathWildcards | bool | Whether or not the ingress object should use path wildcards, i.e., ending with "/*". Some ingresses require this while others do not. You should check which path style your ingress requires. For ingress-nginx this should be set to false. | `false` |
| logging.human | string | Where to send logs that are formatted for readability by a human. Set to an empty string to disable. | `"/dev/stderr"` |
| logging.json | string | Where to send logs that are formatted as JSON. Set to an empty string to disable. | `""` |

This should be set to an empty string if the database does not require a password to connect. | `""` |
| postgres.port | string | The port of the external postgres instance. | `""` |

| ssh.enable | bool | Enables accessing environments via SSH. | `true` |
| storageClassName | string | Sets the storage class for all Coder services and user environments. By default, the storageClassName is unspecified, and thus the default StorageClass is used. If storageClassName is not specified and a default StorageClass does not exist, then the deployment will fail. The storageClass MUST support the ReadWriteOnce access mode. | `""` |
| timescale | object | Contains configuration for the internal database. We don't recommend running this service in production. See the `postgres` section for connecting to an external Postgres database. | `{"image":"","resources":{"limits":{"cpu":"250m","memory":"1Gi"},"requests":{"cpu":"250m","memory":"1Gi","storage":"10Gi"}}}` |
| timescale.image | string | Injected during releases. | `""` |
| timescale.resources | object | Kubernetes resource request and limits for the timescale pod. To unset a value, set it to "".

## Contributing

Templates for Coder services live in the `templates` directory.
Helm compiles templates with `values.yaml` when deploying.

`README.md` is generated from `README.md.gotmpl` to ensure values are correct. Regenerate the readme:

```shell-session
$ make README.md
```

Deprecation notices should be added to `templates/NOTES.txt`.
